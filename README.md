# django-sample-project
A simple flight booking app

You can add whatever names you want for the passengers by logging into django admin (you can do this by creating yourself a superuser, explained below in another app).
And remove and add passengers simply from there(You can also do this via sql commands though).
You are welcome to add any css and js too.

and a small user authentication app

Creates users for the project and lets you login by authenticating username and password.
There is already a superuser(bharadwaj3000), you can create another one by just running "python manage.py createsuperuser".

This also lets you add new data to another app mentioned above.
